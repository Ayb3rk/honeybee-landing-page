    "text": "The grand-project aims to develop a micro-robotic system that will assist the queen bee in grooming, cleaning, and exchanging pheromones with worker bees. To achieve that, several biologists work on understanding and explaining the hive behavior. We provide an exhaustive observing interface helping biologists to gain a better understanding of hive behavior to improve their research."
